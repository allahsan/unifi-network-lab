## üõ∞Ô∏è SSIDs & VLAN Mapping

| SSID Name   | VLAN      | Band           | Broadcasting APs | Clients | Security |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|------------------|---------|----------|
| Home WAN    | VLAN 10   | 2.4GHz + 5GHz  | All              | 9       | WPA2     |
| Ping        | VLAN 20   | 2.4GHz + 5GHz  | All              | 7       | WPA2     |
| IoT_Hive    | VLAN 30   | 2.4GHz only    | All              | 11      | WPA2     |

üìù Notes:
- IoT_Hive is dedicated to 2.4GHz for legacy support.
- SSIDs are mapped to VLANs and broadcast on all APs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Optimization Settings

| Setting                   | Value         |
|---------------------------|---------------|
| Default WiFi Speeds       | Conservative  |
| Channel Width             | Auto (guided by Spectrum Optimizer) |
| Daily Spectrum Optimizer  | Enabled at 10 AM |
| Wireless Meshing          | Enabled       |
| Mesh Monitor              | Enabled       |
| UniFi Auto-Link           | Enabled       |
| WiFiman Support           | Enabled       |

üîÑ **Channel selection is managed automatically** by UniFi‚Äôs built-in spectrum analysis and optimization engine. Admin has not statically assigned any channels.
